# My First Practical DotNet Activity at Residency Tic 18

This practical activity covers the following topics:

- Data types
- Conversion of these types
- Logical operators
- Arithmetic operations
- Equality operators
- Comparison operators

## Data Types

In DotNet, there are several data types that can be used to store different kinds of values. Some commonly used data types are:

- Integer: Used to store whole numbers.
- Floating-Point: Used to store decimal numbers.
- Boolean: Used to store true or false values.
- String: Used to store text.

## Conversion of Types

Sometimes it is necessary to convert a value from one type to another. DotNet provides various methods and operators to convert between different types. For example:

- `int.Parse()`: Converts a string to an integer.
- `double.Parse()`: Converts a string to a double.
- `Convert.ToBoolean()`: Converts a value to a boolean.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. The commonly used logical operators in DotNet are:

- `&&` (AND): Returns true if both operands are true.
- `||` (OR): Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
- `!` (NOT): Returns the opposite of the operand's boolean value.

## Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations are used to perform mathematical calculations. DotNet supports various arithmetic operators, such as:

- `+` (Addition): Adds two numbers.
- `-` (Subtraction): Subtracts one number from another.
- `*` (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers.
- `/` (Division): Divides one number by another.
- `%` (Modulo): Returns the remainder of the division.

## Equality Operators

Equality operators are used to compare the equality of two values. The commonly used equality operators in DotNet are:

- `==` (Equal): Returns true if the operands are equal.
- `!=` (Not Equal): Returns true if the operands are not equal.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare the relationship between two values. The commonly used comparison operators in DotNet are:

- `<` (Less Than): Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.
- `>` (Greater Than): Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
- `<=` (Less Than or Equal): Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
- `>=` (Greater Than or Equal): Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

These are the main concepts covered in this practical DotNet activity. Make sure to practice and experiment with these topics to deepen your understanding. Good luck!
